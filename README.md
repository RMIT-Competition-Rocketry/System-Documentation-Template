# RMIT HIVE System Documentation Template

## Setup

1. Configure your compiler to use `XeLaTeX`

> [!NOTE]
> If using VS Code, settings automatically sourced in `.vscode/settings.json` should do this for you

2. Ensure you have the `Arial` font installed locally. If you do not, consider downloading the associated `.ttf` to `/font` and including it in the project with [fontspec](https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec?lang=en) 

## Usage

Editable areas are commented, most edits are made from about line `337` and below in `main.tex`
